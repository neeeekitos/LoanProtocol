# LoanProtocol

This app is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. The lending platform automatically evaluates the usersâ€™ borrowers and computes their **trustworthiness score** automatically considering their loan activity. The main goal is to **lower or remove the collateral** thanks to the trustworthiness score and make lending more accessible.

The **score** is based on 
  - ProfileScore + 
  - ActivityScore +
  - socialRecommendationScore +
  - LoanRiskScore
  
where *ProfileScore* is the Profile of users' borrowers, *ActivityScore* is the Financial Activity of users' borrowers, *SocialRecommendationScore* is a person who becomes a guarantee for users' borrowers, *LoanRiskScore* is the track record of users' borrowers in another loans.
